oscap-please
============

oscap-please is a tool for storing historical data from OpenSCAP scans and generating user-friendly HTML documents.  It is a student project and, consequently, very on the light side.

At the moment, it consists of two separate tools:
  * The XML to SQL component, which takes multiple OpenSCAP scan reports, strips out relevant information and puts it in a database.
  * The Data Analyser component, which takes a list of user options and generates a stand-alone HTML document.

The project is currently in early stages, and does not currently work.  Still, could be worse.
