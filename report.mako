## AUTHOR AND PROGRAM INFO ####################################################

Author:  Alex Jansons <u5183898@anu.edu.au>
Version: 1.1
Created: 28/07/2014
Modified 09/09/2014 by Thomas Antioch <u5006059@anu.edu.au>

Welcome the report generator of the OhScapPlease (OSP) package! The aim of this
program is to create a HTML report from XML data extracted from a SQL database
based on parameters specified in a config file. The tasks of extracting the
data and parsing the config file are left up to the other components of OSP.

How to use:

To generate a report, simply type: python makereport.py
and then open write2me.html

This program requires the mako library, which you can easily get with pip:
pip install mako

Design:

The minimum viable product (MVP) needs to be able to generate a table with the 
following fields (and a chart):

Definition Name | Definition Result | Machine Name | Date

These are the fields defined in Theo's basic schema: https://cs.anu.edu.au/redm
ine/attachments/download/870/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-02%20at%206.46.54%20pm.png

In the basic schema, the definition result will be one of the following:
notapplicable, notselected, pass, fixed, error, fail. In a future version, the
number of possible results will be reduced to just: fail, pass, notapplicable.

Extended schema: https://cs.anu.edu.au/redmine/attachments/download/922/Screen%
20Shot%202014-08-07%20at%2011.00.53%20pm.png

Some suggested/planned features for future versions include:

-Being able to click a machine name, definition name or result to get more
 information about it.

-The addition of a line/bar chart, to illustrate the overall make up of results
 over a period of time.

## SETUP (MODULE LEVEL CODE) ##################################################
##
<%!
   ## What the heck is module level code? Code within these tags is executed at
   ## the module level of the template, and not within the rendering function
   ## of the template. Therefore, this code does not have access to the
   ## templateâ€™s context and is only executed when the template is loaded into
   ## memory (which can be only once per application, or more, depending on
   ## the runtime environment). See more at:
   ## http://docs.makotemplates.org/en/latest/syntax.html#module-level-blocks
    
   ## Do our module imports
      import datetime
      import  ospdata

   ## Get the date, so we can record when the report was generated
      def getDate():
        return datetime.datetime.now()
    
   ## Get some fake data from the fake data module to create an example report
   ## important: data is a list of dictionaries! Each dictionary can be
   ## thought of as essentially a row in a table. Where the key is the field
   ## and the value is, well, the value for that field. And since data is a
   ## list of rows, we can easily turn it into a table!
      data = ospdata.get_MVP()
    
   ## We're going to count how many results there are, to work out %'s later
   ## Basically, it's the sum of resultcount's values.
      totalresults = 0
    
   ## Accumulates pass/total test numbers for each scan date
      resultcount = {}
      for i in data:
        if i['date'] not in resultcount:
          resultcount[i['date']] = (0,0)
       
        if i['result'] == "Pass":
          resultcount[i['date']] = (resultcount[i['date']][0] + 1, resultcount[i['date']][1] +1)
        else:
          resultcount[i['date']] = (resultcount[i['date']][0], resultcount[i['date']][1] + 1)

      # Works out pass/non pass rate and orders by date
      sorted_results = []
      for key, value in resultcount.iteritems():
        sorted_results.append((key, round((value[0]/float(value[1])),2)*100))
      sorted_results.sort()

%>
##
## HELPER FUNCTIONS ###########################################################
##
## This function creates HTML table rows from dictionaries. Notice that each
## result type has their own <td> class defined. This just colours the cell
## based on the result. Check out style.css to see the implementation.
## TODO: at the moment, the values are hard-coded in the CSS, but it would be
## nice in the future to have the colours defined in one place, so you don't
## have to change them twice. I think a CSS mako template could do this.
<%def name="make_result_row(i)">
    <tr>
        <td>${i['definition_name']}</td>\
        <td class=${i['result']}>${i['result']}</td>\
        <td>${i['machine_name']}</td>\
        <td>${i['date'].isoformat()}</td>\
    </tr>
</%def>

## HTML TEMPLATE ##############################################################

## Now begins the HTML template. Anything that isn't wrapped up in mako tags
## will be written as is., unless it's after ##
